# Default IDF Objects

When developing EnergyPlus simulations, it is quite useful to begin with
a complete, valid, and default object of a given type. When using the
`IDFEditor` tool, this happens for you.

However, it is more extensible if these default objects were available
in individual prepared files. 3rd party programs can easily read these
text files and use them as desired.
